## Usage:
- Retrieve your text data: a book, some articles, tweets or posts. Posts from VK group can be downloaded using my [Bash scripts](https://github.com/Lesterrry/snl-neural/tree/main/Misc).
- Train your network using Jupyter Notebook file. This can be done in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fig3W8L4PAPGei2AE42UTzVzry5uaKvP?usp=sharing).
- Launch [serve.py](https://github.com/Lesterrry/snl-neural/blob/main/Backend/serve.py) script with a binary file in the same directory.
- It should work
